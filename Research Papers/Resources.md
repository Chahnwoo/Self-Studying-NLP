# Resources
An excel spreadsheet containing some of the papers/sites that I've read about NLP. Most topics deal with various aspects of LLMs, such as fine-tuning, prompt-engineering, quantization, etc. Summarizations aren't incredibly high quality but may serve as a starting point for those interested. Intend to review and refine after reaching a higher degree of understanding.
